🔒 Winlock Service
🚀 Enhanced Windows security with HID Device Protection
👦 I created this at the beginning of 2025.

USB Lock Service is a Windows service that strengthens security by automatically locking the system when a USB device (flash drive, mouse, or keyboard) is detected. The lock can be bypassed if a specific file with a predefined name is found on the connected USB flash drive.

✨ Features ✅ Monitors USB connections and detects unauthorized devices 🔒 Automatically locks the Windows session upon detection 🗝️ Allows unlocking with a designated file on the USB drive 👀 Runs silently in the background 🖥️ TeamViewer connections remain unaffected, ensuring seamless remote access ⚡ Automatically starts with Windows and runs on system startup for continuous protection
